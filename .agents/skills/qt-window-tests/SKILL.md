description: How to test the PySide6 main window in this repository -- the offscreen setup, the fixture that keeps a test off the real disk and out of dialogs, testing timer-driven and dialog-driven handlers, and rendering the window to a PNG to check a layout. Use when changing or testing anything in app/main_window.py.

# Testing the window

`app/main_window.py` is excluded from coverage, so these tests are the only thing
standing between a handler and a silent regression. Add one for every handler change.

## Setup

The platform plugin must be selected before `QtWidgets` is imported, and the
`QApplication` is a module-level singleton:

```python
import os
os.environ.setdefault("QT_QPA_PLATFORM", "offscreen")

from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication
from app import main_window as mw

_app = QApplication.instance() or QApplication([])
```

## The fixture

`MainWindow.__init__` loads the real backup from `data/` and writes to `data/` and
`temp/`. A test must stub that out, and must silence the dialogs, or it will block:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def win(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr(mw, "load_backup", lambda path: _empty_backup())
    monkeypatch.setattr(mw.MainWindow, "_write_backup", lambda self, f, n: None)
    monkeypatch.setattr(mw, "write_start_protocol", lambda *a, **k: None)
    w = mw.MainWindow()
    monkeypatch.setattr(mw.QMessageBox, "information", lambda *a, **k: None)
    monkeypatch.setattr(mw.QMessageBox, "warning", lambda *a, **k: None)
    yield w
    w.deleteLater()
```

Widgets can still hold whatever the window loaded at construction, so a test that
inspects a list or a combo box should clear it and fill in known values first rather
than trusting the loaded state.

To assert on what would have been saved, capture the real writer instead of the stub:
keep a module-level reference before the fixture replaces it
(`_REAL_WRITE_BACKUP = mw.MainWindow._write_backup`), monkeypatch `mw.save_backup` to
a recorder, and call the real method through that reference.

## Timers

Do not wait for a `QTimer` to fire. Call the slot directly and assert on
`timer.isActive()`. For that to mean the same thing as a real firing, the slot should
stop its own timer on entry -- a single-shot timer stops itself when Qt fires it, but
not when a test calls the slot.

```python
win._save_all_data()
assert win._auto_send_timer.isActive() is True   # queued, not sent
win._on_auto_send_timeout()
assert len(uploads.calls) == 1
```

Debounce is testable this way too: several edits followed by one timeout must produce
exactly one upload.

## Simulating the referee

`setText` does not emit `textEdited`, so a handler that distinguishes typed input from
values it wrote itself will not see it. Type instead:

```python
from PySide6.QtTest import QTest

edit.clear()
QTest.keyClicks(edit, "30")
```

## Asserting that no dialog appears

Replace the dialog with a raiser rather than a no-op, and the test fails if the code
ever tries to open one:

```python
monkeypatch.setattr(mw.QMessageBox, "warning", _fail)
```

## Checking a layout

The offscreen platform still renders, so a layout change can be verified as an image
instead of by eye:

```python
w.resize(1400, 900)
w.show()
app.processEvents()
w.grab().save("/tmp/window.png")
```

Useful for stretch factors and row ordering. Keep it as a scratch script, not a test.

description: How to run a review cycle on a branch or pull request here -- triaging findings, landing one commit per valid finding with a failing-first test, and posting the summary back to the PR. Includes the bug classes this codebase keeps producing. Use when asked to review, to do review cycles, or to act on review findings.

# Review cycle

A cycle is: review, triage, fix each valid finding in its own commit, then report.

## Reviewing

Use the `code-review` skill against the PR number or the branch. Effort `high` is the
useful default here: the code is small, and the expensive bugs are the ones that only
show up in a specific referee workflow.

## Triage

Take every finding seriously, but check the claim against the code before acting -- a
report can be wrong about the mechanism while pointing at a real problem, or right
about the mechanism and irrelevant in practice. State plainly which findings are valid
and why, and fix them all rather than the convenient subset.

A finding is worth a commit when it changes what the program does for a referee: wrong
data saved, a crash, an unattended path that blocks on a dialog, work silently lost.
Cosmetic notes about a comment or a name go in with the nearest real fix.

## Fixing

One commit per finding, each with a test that fails without it (see `ship-a-change`
for the stash check). Keep the commit message about the user-visible effect, not the
mechanism: `fix: keep the auto upload from moving the protocol selection`.

## Reporting

Post one comment per cycle with a table of finding to fix commit, so the reviewer can
follow what was accepted and how it was closed:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
### Review cycle 1
| Finding | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| ... | `<sha>` ... |
EOF
)"
```

Then run the next cycle against the fixed branch. Fixes introduce their own bugs: the
second cycle here found that a fix for a leaking value across groups still leaked the
same value across a restart.

## Bug classes this codebase keeps producing

Check these first; each one has already shipped at least once.

- **Exceptions escaping into a Qt slot.** PySide6 terminates the application on an
  unhandled exception in a slot, so anything reached from a timer or a signal must not
  raise. `urllib` only wraps failures raised while sending -- a socket timeout or a
  dropped connection while reading the response arrives as a bare `OSError`, and a
  malformed body turns `int(data.get("count"))` into a `TypeError`.
- **Modal dialogs on unattended paths.** A `QMessageBox` is fine for a button the
  referee just pressed. On a timer path it blocks the desk until someone clicks it;
  report there through a status label instead.
- **Timer and debounce state that outlives its subject.** Loading a different backup,
  toggling a mode off, or a successful send must clear whatever was queued for the
  previous state, or the queued work runs against the new one.
- **Widget contents treated as user input.** A value the program wrote into a field
  (a per-group override, a computed time) must not be persisted as if the referee had
  typed it. Track what was typed (`textEdited` fires only for real edits) when the two
  can diverge.
- **Side effects in a save path.** `_save_all_data` re-runs the duplicate check, which
  moves the selection in the protocol list. Anything that saves on a delay must not
  drag the referee's selection with it.
- **The backup file format is positional.** `load_backup` reads its optional tags in a
  fixed order, so a new tag goes last, after `ClientRevision`, and older backups must
  still parse. Add a round-trip test plus one for a backup written without the new tag.
